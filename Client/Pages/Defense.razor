        Baiken has a somewhat unique role as a sort of defensive character in Strive. This does not mean that Baiken is
        designed to run away and counter everything your opponent does. Strive is still an offensively-oriented game and
        the player on offense is always the one who gains more advantage. However, Baiken has many strong neutral tools she
        can use to prevent your opponents from beginning their offense, which some would call defensive. Please refer to the
        <MudLink Href="Neutral">Neutral</MudLink> page to learn more about these strong keep-away tools. If you're looking
        for ways to end your opponent's offense once it's already begun, that's what this page is for.

        If you're anything like me (you're reading essays about how to play a video game, you are at least somewhat like
        me), you think Baiken's <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Hiiragi" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is the coolest thing
        ever and it's one of the main reasons you enjoy playing the character. This is Baiken's premier, unique defensive
        tool. One wrong move from your opponent's offense means they take a huge chunk of damage and are now subjected to
        your offense instead. It's a reversal in every sense of the word. There's a catch, though,
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Hiiragi" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> is a dangerous "feast or famine" type of move
        that can easily make you eat a huge combo if used incorrectly or if called out by the opponent.

        Parrying things is fun, but if you want to access the most consistent situations to parry, you need to first learn
        the importance of blocking. Yes, yes, I know, blocking is "lame" and you paid a bunch of money to play a fighting
        game, not a blocking game, I get it, okay. But hear me out. Blocking is the single best way to learn to stop your
        opponent's offense. If you want to be the very best, like no one ever was, you have to adopt a growth mindset.
        Here's the thing about Strive: every single character is a complete asshole and makes your life miserable in their
        own unique way. This will not change the better you get. Because the better you get, the better your opponents get
        at serving you their character's unique brand of
        <MudLink Href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=200%20years">
            200 years of game design experience
        </MudLink>
        . Of course, I'm being <MudLink Href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/flippant">flippant</MudLink> with
        the way im talking about the game, but you have to accept that the reason defense can sometimes suck so much is
        the same reason that you get to have so much fun when wailing on your opponent with all the crazy stuff you've
        learned to do to them.

        With all that being said, if you want your opponent's offense to be the least painful it can be,
        you need to learn to settle down, cool off, think carefully, and observe your opponent during the course of a match.
        If you don't, you will end up getting hit over and over again until you die and you will have learned very little
        about where the points of interaction are in your opponent's offense. Now that I've laid that out, let's talk about
        Baiken's best investigation tools for figuring out your opponent's offense:
        <MudList T="string" ReadOnly>
            First, universal skills:
            <MudListItem>
                - Blocking
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - Backdash
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - Jump
            </MudListItem>
            Next, Baiken-specific tools:
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5P"/>
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Hiiragi" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
            </MudListItem>

    <br/>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5">Blocking</MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Let's talk about blocking. Just hold the horizontal direction opposite from
        your opponent and you will walk away while also blocking any* moves from your opponent. You can also hold crouch
        while blocking, this prevents you from moving backward. If your opponent has jumped and is in the air, almost any
        attack they do while they're up there will count as an
        <GlossaryLink Term="Overhead Attack"/>. Crouching
        will prevent you from blocking these attacks. Certain attacks (typically performed while crouching) are
        <GlossaryLink Term="Low Attack"/>s. Standing will
        prevent you from blocking these attacks.
    </MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5">Throws</MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Blocking cannot defend against a <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Throw" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>,
        regardless of whether you are crouching. Throws have an
        extremely short range and any throw attempt when not in range will cause that player to
        <GlossaryLink Term="Whiff"/> the throw and be locked
        in an animation that gives a free
        <GlossaryLink Term="Counter Hit"/> if their opponent
        makes contact. Defending against a throw can be done in several ways, you can input throw
        as well within 10 frames of being thrown to
        <GlossaryLink Term="Throw Tech"/> and make your opponent
        bounce off of you, resetting you to
        <GlossaryLink Term="Neutral"/>. Alternatively, you can
        become airborne, either through jump, backdash, some character-specific options
        (<GlossaryLink Term="Tiger Knee"/>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen"/> counts as being airborne), or some other more niche defenses. Being airborne
        makes you immune to ground throws and will cause a whiff from your opponent, making this the highest reward option
        for defending against a throw. You may notice that you or your opponent may whiff a throw, even when you are right
        next to each other and both grounded. This is caused by some form of throw immunity, which is gained in a few ways:
        <MudList T="string" ReadOnly>
            <MudListItem>
                - Being in <GlossaryLink Term="Block stun"/>
                , in <GlossaryLink Term="Hit stun"/>, or
                knocked on the ground.
                This means your opponent cannot perform a true combo into a throw, except
                for some characters who have access to the
                <MudLink Href="https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST/Mechanics#Stagger_Recovery">stagger</MudLink>
                mechanic on their moves, like our <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6K"/> on counterhit. No need to focus on this,
                just be aware that it can happen.
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - Having recently exited block stun or hit stun. You get 5 frames where you are immune to throws after you
                recover from blocking or getting hit. Think about the consequences of this. This means that there must always
                be a 5 frame gap before any throw attempt by your opponent. Every character has a move that is 5 frames or
                faster. Ours is <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5P"/> (it's actually 4 frames!), more about
                <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5P"/> later.
                <MudLink Href="https://www.dustloop.com/w/GGST/Mechanics#Guard_Crush">Guard crush</MudLink> is the exception
                to this rule. Some moves apply guard crush on block, like
                <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Kenjyu" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>. Again, don't focus on it too much, just
                be aware it exists.
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - Performing most invincible reversals. (<BaikenMove Move="Moves.Hiiragi" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
                is an exception to this rule, it does not provide throw immunity. But <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SwordSuper"/>
                does.)
            </MudListItem>
        </MudList>
    </MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5">Backdash</MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Backdash gives you a short period of invulnerability, then leaves you in recovery for a bit. As mentioned earlier,
        it's good for avoiding and punishing throw attempts preemptively. Your opponent typically will have options that
        will catch and punish your backdash, even by accident, so use it sparingly, especially when your back is to the
        corner.
    </MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5">Jump</MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Jump is what it sounds like and I already mentioned how it dodges throws, but it's worth mentioning that jump has a
        small startup time for every character where they cannot block, so holding jump in the middle of your opponent's
        blockstring can give them a free hit. Also note that you can block both lows and overheads while blocking in the air.
        Blocking in the air leaves you super disadvantaged even after you land though, so be careful.
