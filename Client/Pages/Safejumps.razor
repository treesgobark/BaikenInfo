        Baiken has two typical aerial moves you'll use for safejumps: <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/>
        and <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>. The former is typically used after a soft knockdown from
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Tatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> and the latter is typically used after <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>.
        Safejumps using <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/> are more "typical" than <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> ones,
        so we'll discuss those first.

        If you want your safejump to actually work, you have to be holding block as you're
        landing, otherwise you'll start doing your attack before they do their reversal and you'll get counterhit. This
        is because when the opponent does an invincible move when you're safejumping, your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/>
        passes through them, meaning you don't get the little pause that happens when you make contact with an opponent.
        What this means is that when doing a safejump, you should not be trying to block in reaction to your opponent doing a
        reversal because that's impossible, as they happen too fast. What you should be doing instead is blocking as you land,
        waiting some amount of time, then pressing <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>. If you get the rhythm down, you can use
        the same timing every time you <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/> safejump and if your opponent blocks or gets hit,
        your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> comes out at the right time but if they use an invincible option, you will block
        their move before you have the chance to input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>. Blocking the reversal is good because
        it is typical of invincible moves to have fast startup but super long and very punishable recovery, which gives you
        enough time to run up after blocking to get a guaranteed <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> hit.

    <MudText>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> safejumps are a bit different than
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/> ones because <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>
        is a projectile. This means your character doesn't actually experience the little pause I mentioned in the earlier
        section when the <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> makes contact.
        This means you can't use the same timing every time because your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> would just come out
        right in front of their invincible move and you would get counterhit (There is an exception here for the fastest
        of reversals because math, but the timing is so strict and so niche that you shouldn't be concerned with it).
        What this means in practice is that <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>
        safejumps are more reaction-based than <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/> safejumps. You have to wait and see what your
        opponent does in order to make the right decision, but the timing can be a bit tight sometimes.
        The basic idea with <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> safejumps is that while
        you're landing, block by default and resist the urge to hit any buttons until you see one of several things:
        <MudList T="string" ReadOnly>
            <MudListItem>
                - You block their reversal
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - They block your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - They get hit by your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>
            </MudListItem>
        </MudList>
        If they do a reversal, you can block it and punish like normal. If they block or they get hit, you're free to use
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> to continue your offense.
