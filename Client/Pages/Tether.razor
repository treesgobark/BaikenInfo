        Baiken's tether is a fairly complicated mechanic. This page will not cover <MudLink Href="Throwkizeme">throwki</MudLink>
        or <MudLink Href="SKabariRps">RPS after S Kabari</MudLink>. What it will cover is the properties of a tethered
        opponent, options you have that are only available once an opponent is tethered, how to convert hits during tethered
        offense/<GlossaryLink Text="scrambles" Term="scramble"/>, and <GlossaryLink Term="okizeme"/> specific to tether.

        Tether's simple purpose is to keep your opponent within striking distance of you. This applies both to
        <GlossaryLink Text="blockstrings" Term="blockstring"/> and combos. When your opponent reaches a certain horizontal distance
        from you, the tether will stretch like a bungie cord and, after a small delay, pull you both closer to each other.
        Tether duration is on a simple timer, but that timer's remaining duration gets reduced further every time the
        tether is stretched and pulls you and your opponent.

        Baiken's backdash and air backdash change while she has her tether applied to the opponent.
        She will cover more distance than usual, allowing her to forcibly stretch
        the tether from shorter distances than she could otherwise. Because of friction, the tether will move characters
        in the air more than characters standing on the ground, so backdashing in this manner will slingshot you back
        into the opponent for an air approach. If you initiated this slingshot with your grounded backdash, you have the
        additional option to air dash past their head to hit them with a
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> from behind. This would not be possible
        after an air backdash since your air dash would have been consumed already.

    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Note that I said that the backdashing property applies while <i>her</i> tether is applied, which would exclude
        the opposing Baiken's tether. An opponent's tether does not give your moves the small tweaks that would normally
        occur while your tether is active. Keep this in mind because it <i>will</i> cause you to drop combos. I'm not
        going to cover the extent of these differences. Good luck if you want to explore them on your own.

        Tether combos all have distinct stages to them:

        The most common way your opponent will enter the air while tethered is via
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Tatami" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>. You have many ways to route into it. If you
        need ideas, check <MudLink Href="Combos">Combos</MudLink> and look for anything that includes
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Tatami" Naming="NamePreference.Notation"/>. Your opponent could also be launched by
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>, or
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.RedRc" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>, among others. The opponent can also begin the
        tether combo already launched by launching and then comboing into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>. Candidates for this include, but are not limited
        to <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6H"/>,
        <BaikenMove Move="@(Moves._5H.AddPrefix("CH "))"/>, <BaikenMove Move="@(Moves._2H.AddPrefix("CH "))"/>, or
        <BaikenMove Move="@(Moves.DriftRedRc.AddPrefix("Upward "))" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>.

    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Once you've successfully launched your opponent, now it's time to knock them back down again. This is where
        <MudLink Href="Combos">Combo #3.3</MudLink> comes in, as it is your standard air confirm combo. Your opponent
        should get pulled back into you after you launch them, putting them at the perfect distance for you to begin
        with <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>/<BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/>/<BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/>, all of which
        will combo into <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6H"/>. Note that combo #3.3 shows the combo routing into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>. However, with tether you also have the option to
        combo into <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> instead. This gives a less advantageous
        knockdown but does reapply the tether so that you can begin a new round of offense with a fresh one. However,
        if you do choose to end with <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>, you can still
        reapply tether in a different manner if the tether is still applied when you knock them down. Doing an
        <BaikenMove Move="@(Moves._6H.AddPrefix("OTG "))"/> and cancelling into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> will cause it to hit them meaty, which also
        gives you a guaranteed tether application. This method also has the benefit of being safe to many
        <GlossaryLink Term="dragon punch">DPs</GlossaryLink> and some supers since you outspace their hitboxes. As a
        bonus tip, you can also use this technique on an <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
        knockdown in the corner since you are also close to your opponent in that case.

        It's juggling time! You may notice that in your tether combos, you will route into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>, then do your typical safejump and end up flying
        past the opponent. This is an unfortunate reality of tether combos, but is luckily a solvable problem. In between
        your launch and your knockdown, you will want to stall the tether duration with some combination of
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>/<BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/>/<BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/>. These moves will
        <GlossaryLink Term="link"/> into each other, depending on the current gravity scaling of your combo. You may
        have to do some experimentation for any routes you want to use, but as a general rule of thumb, it typically
        doesn't hurt to sneak in a <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/> after any aerial hit <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> you
        land during a tether combo.

        Here's a route that combines all those concepts into one combo and works the same for two common situations you
        will find yourself in.
