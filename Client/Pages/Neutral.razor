        Glossary definition: <GlossaryLink Term="Neutral"/>. Note that we'll
        be including round start as part of neutral for the purposes of this section.

        Baiken has some excellent tools for both round start and neutral. The most consistently occurring scenario between
        every single round of guilty gear is the round start situation. So it's important to know your options, what beats
        those options, and how to beat those. For now, we're only going to talk about 3 options for both round start
        and neutral: <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/>, and <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/>.

    <BaikenMove Typo="Typo.h5" Move="Moves.fS"/>
    <MudText>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> is your god button. It has great
        <GlossaryLink Term="Startup"/> speed and
        <GlossaryLink Term="Recovery"/> speed for its range,
        has a large number of <GlossaryLink Term="Active Frames"/>
        and has a <GlossaryLink Term="Disjointed Hitbox"/>.
        In layman's terms, it's an incredibly well-rounded neutral tool that is above average compared to the rest of the cast.
        Therefore, you should use it and abuse it in neutral as much as you can. <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> does not come
        without weakness though. There are two main ways your opponent will avoid trying to fight against your god button:
        going above it or going below it. This is where the other two neutral options come in.

    <BaikenMove Typo="Typo.h5" Move="Moves.jS"/>
    <MudText>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/> is Baiken's most commonly used way to cover your opponent approaching from the air,
        above your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>.
        All you have to do is jump and hit slash, no <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AirDash" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
        required. Air dash can be dangerous because it leaves you open to your opponent's attacks as you cannot block
        during an air dash. <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/> is an overall great air move and as long as you're not dashing
        in with it, you can form a pretty effective "wall" in the air that your opponents can't get through.

    <BaikenMove Typo="Typo.h5" Move="Moves._2S"/>
    <MudText>
        it's less common that enemies will go under your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, but it can happen and you should
        have an answer prepared. <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> is one such answer. While not as generically amazing as
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> is still a great option to throw out there that is
        relatively safe and effective. Basically, take everything that makes <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> great and reduce
        its effectiveness by about 15%. Still great, but generally only used as an option to cover
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>'s weaknesses, not as a go-to option. Some moves in the game very explicitly show the
        character get really low to the ground to go underneath high-hitting neutral pokes like <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>.
        You'll be able to spot these pretty easily. What is not easy to spot, however, is every character's
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/>. Every character has an attack on forward punch and it is the universal anti-air.
        What that actually means under the surface, though, is that it has a
        <GlossaryLink Term="Disjointed Hitbox"/> up
        high that makes the entire upper half of their body invulnerable. Check out the hitboxes for Baiken's
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/>:

        Note how the <GlossaryLink Term="Hitbox"/>
        (<MudText Color="Color.Error" HtmlTag="span">red</MudText> box) is high and the
        <GlossaryLink Term="Hurtbox"/>
        (<MudText Color="Color.Info" HtmlTag="span">blue</MudText> box) is squished down really low, even though Baiken
        herself is still standing. This is why Baiken's <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/> (and every other character's) will
        both beat aerial moves and go under your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>. Over time you will learn what each
        character's universal anti-air looks like, but before then, you can usually assume that if your opponent punched
        your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> and counterhit you, it was their 6P that did it and now you know that if they
        keep doing that, you can use <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> instead to counterhit them.

        You can consider the arena you're fighting in to have 3 different horizontal "lanes" like so:
    </MudText>
    <MudContainer Style="text-align: center"><MudImage Style="max-width: 100%;width: 1080px" Src="Lanes.png"/></MudContainer>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        By default, you and your opponent are in the middle lane, if your opponent is here (or you think they will be here
        soon), this is where you use <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>. If your opponent goes up to the high lane, match them
        with a jump and a <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/>. If your opponent is spending a lot of time low to the ground in
        the low lane, start throwing out more <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/>. As a newer player, the vast majority of your
        time spent in a match will be spent in neutral due to players' offensive strategies not being fully fleshed out.
        As long as you're around the distance of your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> or farther, that's when you should be
        using these tips. Once you're used to using these three options, you'll want to make sure you can
        <GlossaryLink Term="Convert"/> these three options into
        a knockdown. To learn how to convert these options into knockdowns, reference the first section in the
        <MudLink Href="Combos">Combos</MudLink> page. More information about why knockdowns are so important in the
        <MudLink Href="Pressure">Pressure</MudLink> and <MudLink Href="Safejumps">Safejumps</MudLink> pages.
