        be including round start as part of neutral for the purposes of this section.

        Baiken has some excellent tools for both round start and neutral. The most consistently occurring scenario between
        every single round of guilty gear is the round start situation. So it's important to know your options, what beats
        those options, and how to beat those. For now, we're only going to talk about 3 options for both round start
        and neutral: <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/>, and <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/>.

        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> is your god button. It has great
        <GlossaryLink Term="Startup"/> speed and
        <GlossaryLink Term="Recovery"/> speed for its range,
        has a large number of <GlossaryLink Term="Active Frames"/>
        and has a <GlossaryLink Term="Disjointed Hitbox"/>.
        In layman's terms, it's an incredibly well-rounded neutral tool that is above average compared to the rest of the cast.
        Therefore, you should use it and abuse it in neutral as much as you can. <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> does not come
        without weakness though. There are two main ways your opponent will avoid trying to fight against your god button:
        going above it or going below it. This is where the other two neutral options come in.

        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/> is Baiken's most commonly used way to cover your opponent approaching from the air,
        above your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>.
        All you have to do is jump and hit slash, no <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AirDash" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
        required. Air dash can be dangerous because it leaves you open to your opponent's attacks as you cannot block
        during an air dash. <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/> is an overall great air move and as long as you're not dashing
        in with it, you can form a pretty effective "wall" in the air that your opponents can't get through.

    <br/>
    <MudText>
        it's less common that enemies will go under your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, but it can happen and you should
        have an answer prepared. <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> is one such answer. While not as generically amazing as
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>, <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> is still a great option to throw out there that is
        relatively safe and effective. Basically, take everything that makes <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> great and reduce
        its effectiveness by about 15%. Still great, but generally only used as an option to cover
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>'s weaknesses, not as a go-to option. Some moves in the game very explicitly show the
        character get really low to the ground to go underneath high-hitting neutral pokes like <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>.
        You'll be able to spot these pretty easily. What is not easy to spot, however, is every character's
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/>. Every character has an attack on forward punch and it is the universal anti-air.
        What that actually means under the surface, though, is that it has a
        <GlossaryLink Term="Disjointed Hitbox"/> up
        high that makes the entire upper half of their body invulnerable. Check out the hitboxes for Baiken's
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/>:

    <MudContainer Style="text-align: center"><MudImage Src="Moves/6P_hitbox.png"/></MudContainer>

    <MudText>
        Note how the <GlossaryLink Term="Hitbox"/>
        (<MudText Color="Color.Error" HtmlTag="span">red</MudText> box) is high and the
        <GlossaryLink Term="Hurtbox"/>
        (<MudText Color="Color.Info" HtmlTag="span">blue</MudText> box) is squished down really low, even though Baiken
        herself is still standing. This is why Baiken's <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/> (and every other character's) will
        both beat aerial moves and go under your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>. Over time you will learn what each
        character's universal anti-air looks like, but before then, you can usually assume that if your opponent punched
        your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> and counterhit you, it was their 6P that did it and now you know that if they
        keep doing that, you can use <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/> instead to counterhit them.

        You can consider the arena you're fighting in to have 3 different horizontal "lanes" like so:
    </MudText>
    <MudContainer Style="text-align: center"><MudImage Style="max-width: 100%;width: 1080px" Src="Lanes.png"/></MudContainer>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        By default, you and your opponent are in the middle lane, if your opponent is here (or you think they will be here
        soon), this is where you use <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>. If your opponent goes up to the high lane, match them
        with a jump and a <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/>. If your opponent is spending a lot of time low to the ground in
        the low lane, start throwing out more <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S"/>. As a newer player, the vast majority of your
        time spent in a match will be spent in neutral due to players' offensive strategies not being fully fleshed out.
        As long as you're around the distance of your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> or farther, that's when you should be
        using these tips. Once you're used to using these three options, you'll want to make sure you can
        <GlossaryLink Term="Convert"/> these three options into
        a knockdown. To learn how to convert these options into knockdowns, reference the first section in the
        <MudLink Href="Combos">Combos</MudLink> page. More information about why knockdowns are so important in the
        <MudLink Href="Pressure">Pressure</MudLink> and <MudLink Href="Safejumps">Safejumps</MudLink> pages.

    <br/>
    <MudText>
        Instant air dashing is a powerful tool in your arsenal, but let's talk about why it's not something I've
        mentioned in this neutral framework. <BaikenMove Move="Moves.IAD"/> is a powerful
        "<GlossaryLink Term="Neutral Skip"/>" that is
        <strong>reactable with anti-air moves</strong>. Moves like
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P"/> (which every character has some version of) can entirely shut this down as an
        attack angle against opponents with sufficiently trained reactions.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h6" Style="font-style: italic;">
        However
    </MudText>
    <MudText>
        Attacking with an <BaikenMove Move="Moves.IAD"/> while your opponent has committed to a move with long
        <GlossaryLink Term="recovery"/> time means that they are unable to input their anti-air to counter you. This
        typically requires <GlossaryLink Term="Read" Text="reading"/> your opponent's next move, but as your opponent
        could also just <i>not</i> use that move, this is an inherently less stable gameplan than punishing your
        opponent's mistakes with less committal options, like the ones described above.
    </MudText>
    <MudText Typo="Typo.h5" Style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">
        However
    </MudText>
    <MudText>
        Your opponents are <i>human</i>. And because of that, they have flaws. One of these flaws may very well be a
        lack of well-trained anti-air reactions. This can be abused by using <BaikenMove Move="Moves.IAD"/> >
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jS"/> > <BaikenMove Move="@(Moves.Youzansen.AddPrefix("(Delayed) "))" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>, but not delaying
        the <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> will actually put you in a disadvantageous position if your opponent
        blocks it and delaying it too much will leave you <i>very</i> disadvantageous. Due to the additional execution
        requirements, as well as it not being entirely needed in order for you to have a functional neutral gameplan,
        I recommend against brand new players using this as an option. Additionally, I wouldn't even recommend more
        experienced players use it until they've practiced and are confident in their ability to properly delay the
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>.

        What about <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Typo="Typo.h5" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>
        and <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Typo="Typo.h5" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>?
    </MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is incredibly slow to start up and applies tether so even if you
        do land it, you'd need to learn how to handle tether shenanigans to make effective use of it. Too much complexity
        and not enough situations in which it's useful for it to be in a starter guide. Any further information may be
        found in <MudLink Href="Tether">Tether</MudLink>.
    </MudText>
    <br/>
    <MudText>
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is actually a very commonly useful neutral tool.
        It has incredible reach, is
        safe on block, and can confirm into a hard knockdown on hit by cancelling into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>. Plus at longer ranges like this,
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>
        is typically also safe on block which means it's not always a bad idea to just throw it out. Also keep in mind
        that <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> can be performed even if the first part
        whiffs, which is nice for neutral.
        The one true downside of this move that holds it back from being part of the original framework is its
        long total animation time, making it very susceptible to <BaikenMove Move="Moves.IAD"/>, as noted in the
        previous section. It's pretty typical that players will fall into a pattern of using <BaikenMove Move="Moves.IAD"/>
        all the time so if you rely on using <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> too much,
        you may play right into the hands of these animals. So use it if you'd like, just be wary of the risks.
