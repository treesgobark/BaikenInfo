<MudText>
    "Psychic damage" is a <MudLink Href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/facetious">facetious</MudLink> term
    for any in-game action or setup that negatively affects your opponent's state of mind during play, usually by
    utilizing high-risk, high-reward setups or performing actions that goad or confuse your opponent. If you've ever
    thought to yourself "I can't believe I let myself get hit by that" or gotten a bit heated when your opponent kept
    spamming the same thing against you, you have been a victim of psychic damage. Despite how it sounds, dealing
    psychic damage to your opponent is not just a joke and actually has an effect on how your opponent makes decisions.
    It is closely related to the concepts of

    <MudLink Href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Mental%20Stack" Target="_blank">mental stack</MudLink>. In this
    section, I'll share some of the methods I've used to bully players into taking more dangerous options on their
    defense and how to abuse your opponent's lack of knowledge to delete their health bar. Expect lots of knowledge
    checks, <MudLink Href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Fake">fake</MudLink>-ass setups, and brain-melting maneuvers.
    Check back later for some examples once I've filled out this section more.
