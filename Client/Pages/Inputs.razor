        A lot of new players struggle with inputting moves in this game when starting out, especially special moves. It's
        because the game doesn't really explain to you how cancelling and buffering work. But that's why I'm here.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I'm going to separate inputs into three categories: attack inputs, directional inputs, and motion inputs. Let's
        tackle them one at a time. I'm not talking about charge inputs because Baiken doesn't have any and I'm lazy.

        Attack inputs are your punch, kick, slash, heavy slash, and dust buttons, also known as P, K, S, HS, and D. I will
        be using these abbreviations for the remainder of the article. All the moves that can be done with just an attack
        input and no motion input is called a normal attack. Every move in this game takes time to start up, stays
        active for some time, then leaves you in a punishable recovery state for another period of time. However, for most
        moves, this punishable recovery time can be cancelled into other moves. For the purposes of this article, I'm
        just going to be using a couple moves but if you want the full story of what moves cancel into what, please
        refer to this image:

            Written as a list of rules, the chart says:
            <MudListItem>- P cancels into any P</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>- Lights (P and K) cancel into command normals</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>- K cancels into D</MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS">Close S</BaikenMove> cancels into anything of the same weight or heavier
                (S, H, and D) and command normals
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S">Crouching S</BaikenMove> and
                <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS">Far S</BaikenMove> cancel into H
            </MudListItem>

        In order to cancel one attack into another, it is imperative that you wait for the next attack to make contact
        with the opponent. If you press the next attack before you make contact, nothing will happen and you will
        still continue through the active and recovery portions of the move. You can try to hit some buttons way too
        fast and see for yourself, especially your slower buttons, like trying
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2S">Crouching S</BaikenMove> into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2H">Crouching H</BaikenMove> exactly once really fast.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Directional inputs are as they sound: holding on of the 8 directions on your D-pad, WASD, or (God forbid) analog
        stick. Holding some of these directions will give you different attacks sometimes, most typically down or
        forward. You can start holding them whenever you want and release them whenever you want so long as they're
        down when you press the attack button. Any move that is done with forward plus an attack button is called a
        command normal, but they're not actually different from any other normals, it's just that between the cast,
        the command normals that characters have can vary. For example, Sol has a forward S, but not a forward K. Baiken
        doesn't have a forward S, but does have a forward K. Baiken's command normals are
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6P">Forward P</BaikenMove>, <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6K">Forward K</BaikenMove>, and
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._6H">Forward H</BaikenMove>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Motion inputs are all reserved for special moves. They're the inputs where you make a smooth motion between a
        set of directional inputs, which encompass both quarter circles, half circles and a couple outliers (outliers 
        which I'm not explaining because Baiken doesn't have them). What's important to note about motion inputs is that
        unlike attack inputs, they do not need to be done after you make contact with the opponent. This means you can
        and should be <GlossaryLink Term="Buffer">Buffering</GlossaryLink> your motion input when you intend to cancel
        a normal into a special move. What this means is that if you want to cancel
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2H">Crouching H</BaikenMove> into
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>, you want to hold
        crouch, press H, then immediately move to holding back and going through your half circle, before you even have
        any idea whether this <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2H">Crouching H</BaikenMove> is going to land or not. Then, if
        the move does make contact, you already have your half circle buffered and ready to go and you can input H to
        begin your special move.
