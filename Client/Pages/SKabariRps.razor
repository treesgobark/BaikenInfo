        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> is an all-in-one
        <GlossaryLink Term="Pressure Reset"/> tool that can
        cancelled into from any normal and is almost entirely <GlossaryLink Term="disjointed"/> (it's not a projectile).
        It also pulls them closer to you and applies tether to the opponent, attaching them to you and you to them,
        both on block and on hit (see <MudLink Href="Tether"/> for why this is cool). Plus, it converts into a full
        combo from any distance on normal hit, counter hit, or aerial hit. Hard not to love it. There is a downside
        though, the move is slow as heck on startup and thus reactable. Though the saving grace of this unfortunate
        fact is that it looks very similar to <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> and as a
        result is harder to react to than you may think.

        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is +3 on block regardless of how meaty it hits
        the opponent. This is because both versions of kabari cancel their remaining active frames (but not recovery)
        when they make contact with the opponent. The combination of +3, vacuum effect, and tether gives baiken the
        perfect situation for a whole host of offensive options to be represented. Let's talk about them:

        It converts into a full combo on normal hit
        (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/>), counter hit (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> or
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>), or aerial hit (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> or
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/>).
