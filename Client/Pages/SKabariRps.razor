        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> is an all-in-one
        <GlossaryLink Term="Pressure Reset"/> tool that can
        cancelled into from any normal and is almost entirely <GlossaryLink Term="disjointed"/> (it's not a projectile).
        It also pulls them closer to you and applies tether to the opponent, attaching them to you and you to them,
        both on block and on hit. Plus, it converts into a full
        combo from any distance on normal hit, counter hit, or aerial hit. Hard not to love it. There is a downside
        though, the move is slow as frick on startup and thus reactable. Though the saving grace of this unfortunate
        fact is that it looks very similar to <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> and as a
        result is harder to react to than you may think.

        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.SKab" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is +3 on block regardless of how
        <GlossaryLink Term="meaty"/> it hits
        the opponent. (Info for nerds: This is because both versions of kabari cancel their remaining active frames
        (but not recovery) when they make contact with the opponent). The combination of +3, vacuum effect, and tether
        gives baiken the perfect situation for a whole host of offensive options to be represented. Let's talk about them:
        <MudList T="string" ReadOnly>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5P"/>: Your safest and typically most effective option. has 4f startup and
                you're +3, so this leaves a 1f gap, not enough for you to be thrown by the opponent.
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/>: Your safest low option. Frametraps anything except throw, so you
                typically want your opponent to be conditioned away from doing that before you go for this.
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen"/>: Utilizes your conditioning of the opponent to make them hold
                a 10f gap and subject themselves to high/low mix. Still doesn't convert without meter or counterhit.
                Notably, beats throw as this is an aerial move.
            </MudListItem>
            <MudListItem>
                - <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Throw"/>: Another option your opponent must be conditioned for. The amount
                that you have to delay your throw input here makes it a little tough to get the timing right to both
                throw the opponent if they do nothing and to tech their throw if they throw you. Since they're tethered
                you have the option to hold the <MudText HtmlTag="span" Color="Color.Warning">dust</MudText> input to
                do a full combo. See <MudLink Href="Tether">Tether Mechanics</MudLink> for more info.
            </MudListItem>
        </MudList>
        
        
        It converts into a full combo on normal hit
        (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2K"/>), counter hit (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> or
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/>), or aerial hit (link into <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> or
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/>).
