    The first rule of offense is that you must first earn the privilege of getting in close to your opponent. You can't
    just run at them and expect to be able to land your best offensive starter: <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>. Most of
    the time your opponent isn't going to let you do that for free. If you want to get in close, you need to get a
    knockdown on your opponent. To learn to do this check out the <MudLink Href="Neutral">Neutral</MudLink> page.

    In a nutshell, pressure is the method by which you turn your opponent's disadvantage state (and by extension your
    advantage stage) into health loss and eventually round loss. Advantage and disadvantage will typically change
    between each player many times in one round, but what does it actually mean to be disadvantaged? The simplest way to
    define advantage is that the advantaged player gets to act before the disadvantaged player does. You will gain
    familiarity with this concept over the course of this section.

    Let's walk through an example of a typical
    <MudLink Href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Pressure" Target="_blank">blockstring</MudLink> step-by-step. Suppose
    you have just knocked your opponent down with
    <BaikenMove Move="Moves.HkabH" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>. You're in advantage because you have the ability
    to act and make decisions while your opponent is stuck on the ground, unable to act. We typically use this time to
    set up a <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> safejump. More information about
    that in the <MudLink Href="Safejumps">Safejumps</MudLink> section.

    Now that you've set up your knockdown and your safejump, your opponent has a choice as they're waking up:
    <MudList T="string" ReadOnly>
        <MudListItem>
            - Do an invincible reversal (if you've performed your safejump correctly, you would block it and they would
            eat a guaranteed punish since invincible reversals are always punishable on block, though there are some
            that will take specific knowledge to punish.)
        </MudListItem>
        <MudListItem>
            - Do a non-invincible move (if you've performed your safejump correctly, your opponent will get hit
            by the <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> mat here immediately since
            it's an active projectile that is already on top of them when they
            wake up. You can combo off of this hit, but it will take some practice.)
        </MudListItem>
        <MudListItem>
            - Block (This is by far their safest option because there isn't actually anything that can punish them for
            blocking the <BaikenMove Move="Moves.AerialTatami" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/>)
        </MudListItem>
    </MudList>
    It should be clear to see that if the opponent doesn't want to get blown up and die, that their only real option is
    to block. But your opponent might not know that, so you always have to be ready for them to do one of the other two
    options. You want to have the ability to convert either of those hits into a combo that ends in a safejump so that you
    can loop back around to the beginning of your pressure again. Combos for these starters can be found in the "Now
    That's What I Call Hit Confirms 56" section of the <MudLink Href="Combos">Combos</MudLink> page. Once your opponent
    actually learns to block, you can move on.
