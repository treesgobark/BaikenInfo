        The title of this one is a
        <MudLink Href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/portmanteau">portmanteau</MudLink> of
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Throw" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> and
        <GlossaryLink Term="Okizeme"/>. I just think this sounds
        funny, literally no one else uses this term. Feel free to refer to it as "throwki" as well which I think sounds
        even funnier.

        Anyway, throwki is all about how you approach the situation on your opponent's knockdown, specifically the knockdown
        you get after a successful <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Throw" Naming="NamePreference.English"/>. Baiken is a legitimate
        contender for "best normal throw in the game" because of the tether it applies and the vast number of options she
        has for oki afterward. Luckily, you don't need to be cracked and practice for five years to do cool things because
        Baiken's most basic setups for throw are still some of the most powerful. Let's talk about those.

        Note: You can refer to the <MudLink Href="Tether">Tether</MudLink> section to learn how to combo off of any of the
        setups shown here. Tether combos are very modular and depend on your initial conditions, so it's easiest to learn
        them as a collection of rules rather than committing specific routes to memory.

        Baiken gets some of the best "bang for your buck" throw oki in the whole cast with this simple setup:
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Throw" Naming="NamePreference.English"/> your opponent, hold forward jump during the throw
        animation, once you enter the air you can let go of forward jump, land on the ground, then
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>. Yes, it is that easy to get powerful oki from baiken's throw. Check it out:

        You can also do <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2D"/> when you land to catch anyone who's blocking high, but the on-block
        situation is considerably worse than the on block situation with <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>. I personally prefer
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> with this setup in my own play and rarely, if ever, use <BaikenMove Move="Moves._2D"/>
        after throw.

    <MudText>
        This is the same setup as the last one but with one difference: you whiff <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/> in the air
        to control how fast you fall, causing you to land on one side or the other depending on the time you input the
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.jH"/>. Use it early to land same-side. Use it later to land cross-up. Here's a video:
