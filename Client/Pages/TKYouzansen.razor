        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen"/> also known as <GlossaryLink Term="Tiger Knee"/> Youzansen or
        Instant Air Special Youzansen is one of Baiken's standout tools. It's a gapless, unreactable overhead that,
        when paired with <BaikenMove Move="Moves.RedRc"/> gives very rewarding combos on hit and mixups on block.
        Without the tension to spend on <BaikenMove Move="Moves.RedRc"/>, it provides a very risky way to
        incentivize your opponent to block high during your meterless pressure. On hit, your reward is about a third of
        the damage of a typical combo with some pretty lackluster <GlossaryLink Term="Oki"/>. In midscreen, you get
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.fS"/> oki (this is pretty terrible) and in the corner, you get
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> oki (much better but still pretty poor given how good our typical oki is). On the
        flipside, if your opponent blocks it, you're at point blank range and super minus with no cancel options, which
        gives every character in the game a full close slash starter punish on you (this is really bad).

        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is typically the most difficult single move input you have on Baiken.
        That doesn't mean it's impossible or anything, but it's pretty tricky, so I'm compiling some tips for inputting
        it. First off, there's two distinct ways you can perform this input: via a buffered jump cancel or doing it raw.
        Recall that you have to be in the air to input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen"/>, so if you want to input
        this at the lowest possible height, in theory you would need to input jump, then in the 4 frames of prejump,
        you would need to input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen"/>. 4 inputs and
        4 frames means you need to be nearly frame perfect. You can get around this by buffering a jump cancel from
        either <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/> or <BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/>. Simply land one of these moves, then
        hit jump. It'll cancel your recovery and let you jump immediately. The jump buffer Tiger Knee input takes
        advantage of the hitstop caused by landing one of these moves to allow you to hit jump and then have
        significantly more time to input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Notation"/> afterward.
        So all in all, the input looks like <BaikenMove Move="Moves.cS"/>/<BaikenMove Move="Moves._5K"/> >
        <BaikenMove Move="Moves.ForwardJumpCancel"/> > <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen"/>. Doing forward jump here is
        not guaranteed to make this work, but it does help immensely with spacing consistency. I recommend getting used
        to doing forward jump.

        The other way to input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> is doing it raw.
        This refers to doing the input <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen"/>, no jump cancel buffer required. This
        input method takes advantage of the game buffering your quarter circle for you for a little bit by having you
        input the quarter circle first, then jump, then slash. That quarter circle gets stored by the game for a small
        amount of time, just enough for you to get a jump in between your motion input and attack input. Note that because
        you're hitting 2 and then 9 soon after, that baiken will perform a superjump in this instance. It will be tough
        to see, since <BaikenMove Move="Moves.Youzansen" Naming="NamePreference.Friendly"/> slows your vertical air
        momentum by a large amount, but it
        matters for 2 reasons: it increases your disadvantage on block by a small amount and it also consumes your air
        action, which means no double jump or air dash. This lack of an air action only actually matters for specific
        combo routes, but it is required to take those routes. You can avoid the superjump with one of three methods:
        you can do the jump cancel buffer input method, you can hold down 2 for a small amount of time and then do the
        rest of your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen"/>, or you can input your <BaikenMove Move="Moves.TkYouzansen"/>
        in a slower and smoother fashion such that the 2 input and the 9 input occur farther away from each other.
