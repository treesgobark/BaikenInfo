        Game Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the decision-making processes of individuals and groups.
        You can use this to your advantage to become a better player. I've filled in an example defensive situation for you to
        try it out. Positive numbers mean you get damage on the opponent and negative numbers mean they get damage on
        you. Try adjusting the probabilities or adding your own moves/numbers to see what happens.
