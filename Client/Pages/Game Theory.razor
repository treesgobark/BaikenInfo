            Game Theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the decision-making processes of individuals and groups.
            You can use this to your advantage to become a better player. I've filled in an example defensive situation for you to
            try it out. Positive numbers mean you get damage on the opponent and negative numbers mean they get damage on
            you. This doesn't mean you
            should always pick the highest Expected Value, because keep in mind that your opponent will become more or less
            likely to use certain options as the match progresses. Try simulating an opponent who has gotten parried on your
            wakeup a bunch of times by changing the probability of their next attack accordingly and see how the Expected
            Values change.
